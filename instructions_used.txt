We've got wind and temperature cube-map, now we need to implement wind moving temperature in its direction, here's the approach:
You have:
a scalar field: temperature on a cubemap surface
a vector field: wind on the same surface
You want to advect temperature by wind without artefacts (streaks, parallel lines, per-cell motion).
Those artefacts come from forward (push) advection or from advecting in face-local UV space.
Correct model
This is scalar advection:
∂T∂t+v⃗⋅∇T=0
∂t
∂T
​

v
⋅∇T=0
You must pull, not push.
Algorithm (semi-Lagrangian advection)
For every texel:
Treat the texel centre as a 3D point on the cube-sphere
(direction vector from planet centre).
Treat wind as a 3D tangent vector at that point
(orthogonal to surface normal).
Backtrace:
move backwards in time along wind:
p′=move_on_surface(p,−v⃗⋅Δt)
p
′
=move_on_surface(p,−
v
⋅Δt)
Convert
p′
p
′
back to cubemap coordinates.
Sample old temperature at
p′
p
′
(bilinear, cross-face correct).
Write that value as the new temperature at
p
p.
This moves the field coherently and avoids striping.
Important details
Do not advect in face UV space directly.
Do not push values forward.
Δt must be small relative to texel size.
Sampling must work across cube faces.
Nearest-neighbour sampling causes streaks.
