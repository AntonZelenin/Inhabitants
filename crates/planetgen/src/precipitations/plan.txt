We need to implement precipitations map, it will hold a probability for a rain at a time interval (will be implemented later, now only probability map).

Also we need to implement main precipitation drivers (simplified):

1. Rising air → rain. Sinking air → dry. You need to use raising/sinking air map we created before.
(Convergence, low pressure, warm air going up.)

2. Temperature → sets how much moisture air can hold.
Warm = more vapour potential.

3. Water availability → oceans > land.
Evaporation source strength.

4. Wind transport → moves moisture around.
Brings wet air to land, dries it elsewhere.

5. Topography → mountains force air up.
Windward wet, leeward rain shadow.

You need to add rain settings to the config and to ui, to a new tab "Precipitations".
